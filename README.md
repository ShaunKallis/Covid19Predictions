# Covid19Predictions
Very simplistic but so far surpisingly accurate model predicting the number of people affected on a given date.

The numbers presented here are shocking.  The rate of infection appears to be roughly compounding at 14% daily.  10-20% of those infected die.  The numbers indicate, from the time a person is officially counted as infected to the time they have an outcome(recovery or death) is about 12-16 days .  They indicate how quickly it will spread around the world if it continues to spread at the dame rate.  It is unlikely that it will spread at the same rate outside of China if governments and the World Health Organization take decisive action.

The numbers presented here are official numbers.

Many factors affect the spread of the virus.  Some places recieve very few international travelers and thus the virus will take longer to reach them than indicated.  Countries which take action to track down or follow those who are more likely to have been infected and who put quarentine measures and travel restrictions in place early will be much less likely to loose between a 5th and a 10th of their populations which appears to be what China is facing.  

It is suspected that China has been downplaying the total number of people infected and people who have died.  Reason China might do this include lack of testing supplies or testing facilities.  People may have the disease who are too sick to get to the proper facilieites.  Some people may fear getting tested because they are affraid of being near someone who does have the disease.  They may fear the quarentine facilites and decide to self quarentine.  The Chinese government has arrested whistle blowers and citizen journalists who have made information about the disease public.  The Chinese government may be concerned that the economy will suffer if the true effect of the disease is known, if they have been covering information up.  Further supporting that the disease has spread faster and has been more deadly than China let on, when the city of Wuhan with 11 million residents was quarentined, fewer than 500 cases had been reported and fewer than 20 deaths (https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/20/wuhan-quarantine-virus-china-coverup-government-how-scared-should-you-be-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus/)
